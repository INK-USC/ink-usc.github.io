      </h3>
        
          <p>Students will design and carry out a research project that aims to answer a question in natural language
            processing (Learning Objective O4). Students will work individually or in team of two or three. The focus of
            the class project can be research-focused or application-focused. A research-focused project will develop
            models and analyze data of an existing problem in NLP, or formulate a new problem altogether. An
            application-focused project will train (possibly only fine-tuning) and deploy NLP models to new application
            areas, while not necessarily developing any novel research question to be answered. Students will leverage
            tools, concepts, and techniques presented in the class. The project involves identifying a communication or
            exploration need that language could resolve, data sources available to inform the problem and method,
            and the techniques needed to approach it. The grading distribution for deliverables of the course project as
            well as expectations for each deliverable are detailed below.
            The deliverables include a project proposal (1 page single space) plus a project proposal pitch at the class, a
            mid project report (4-5 pages single space), final presentation (timed, with time for questions) and a final
            report (7-8 pages single space for the main document, up to 15 with appendix/figures). The final report will
            be due on the day of the University-scheduled final examination. Reports will be graded based on clarity,
            and completeness. The project is total 55% of final grade with the following breakdown:</p>

      </h3>
    

<p>The project proposal (1 page, 10pt font size (using the <a href="https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files">*CL paper submission template</a>)) should outline the type of project (research-focused or
  application-focused), and then answer the following questions clearly in a sentence and/or a few
  paragraphs each, as appropriate: What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no
  jargon. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice? What is new in your approach and
  why do you think it will be successful? Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make? What
  are the risks? What could go wrong, and how will you pivot early on if that happens? How much will it cost?
  That is, what resources will you need in terms of time and computation? Are these reasonable for a
  semester and what access you have? Identify two milestones along the way to your finished project.</p>

<!-- <p>Student teams should submit a ~1-page proposal  for their project by Week 5. The proposal should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>state and motivate the problem by providing a problem or <strong>task definition</strong> (preferably with example inputs and expected outputs),</li>
  <li>situate the problem within <strong>related work</strong> (this might help you find sources of data for training a model for your task),
    <ul>
      <li>Related work: publications, start by looking in the <a href="https://aclanthology.org/">ACL anthology</a></li>
      <li>References do not count towards page limit, but please follow the correct format</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>state a <strong>hypothesis to be verified</strong> and how you will evaluate if it is valid, and</li>
  <li>provide a brief description of the approach to be followed to verify the hypothesis (such as proposed models and baselines, no need to provide all the modeling details at this point).</li>
</ul>

<p>We highly encourage students to work towards a problem involving predictive models, hence it’s worth thinking about the five key ingredients of supervised learning: <strong>data</strong>, model, loss function, optimization algorithm and inference / <strong>evaluation</strong>.</p> -->

      </h3>
    
<p>The project midterm report (4-5 pages) should cover these questions in detail: What are you trying to do?
  Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon. Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will
  it make? Additionally, it should cover related work in detail, as well as document the proposed method and
  what is new in that approach, as well as how you plan to conduct experiments, what hypotheses these
  experiments test, and how you will evaluate the quality of the results. If you have preliminary results to
  report, they should be discussed here. Additionally, you should revisit your milestones from the proposal
  and document your progress with respect to these, and propose updated milestones for the remainder of
  the semester.</p>
<!-- <p>Student teams should submit a ~3-page progress report (using the *CL paper submission template) for their project by the end of Week 9. This report should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>once again describe the project’s goals (it is okay if this has changed slightly since the proposal, based on the feedback),</li>
  <li>contain all details on the dataset (your dataset should mostly be collected by this time),</li>
  <li>contain some initial results (think of this as a motivating results or analysis of your data to support your hypothesis), and</li>
  <li>must outline a concrete plan of what will be done before the final report.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the initial results might be inconclusive, you are expected to have made non-trivial progress by this point. The project proposal may be extended for this report. Please take into consideration the earlier feedback you received, and address those inline (you may highlight these in a different text color if you wish to draw the grader’s attention).</p> -->

      </h3>
    
<p>The project final presentation (~10min presentation + 3min FAQ) will be given by your team in class and
  graded on clarity, completeness, and presentation quality (by instructor and TA). Each member of the group
  should present for about equal time. Your presentation should convey: the main takeaway you have reached
  or aim to reach with your project; a brief motivation which can include some background; the key insight
  that overcomes the problems presented in the motivation with what was done before this project; the
  technical details behind the insight; and an overview of what remains to be done before the final report.
  

<!-- <p>Please prepare for a 15-20 mins presentation + 5-10 mins QA. Too long / too short presentations will be penalized. There should be some more progress since the progress report. Please show up for other presentations + ask questions - this will be part of your participation grade. After the presentation, please upload your project slides for grading</p>-->

      </h3>
    

 <p>The project final report (7-8 pages) should answer all the following questions in detail, and is expected to
  include revised content from the midterm report based on feedback your team received at that time. What
  were you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon. Who cares? If you were
  successful, what difference would it make? How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
  What is new in your approach and why did you think it would be successful? How did you conduct
  experiments? What hypotheses did those experiments test? How did you evaluate the quality of the
  results? What are the results of your experiments? What did you discover? Were you able to support your
  hypotheses? What are the main takeaways of your project? What would you do next if you wanted to keep
  working in this space? What new questions can you formulate given the work this semester?</p>

<!--<ul>
  <li>A short abstract, highlighting the goal of the project and a single takeaway from the results.</li>
  <li>Introduction and motivation for the problem. What are the key hypotheses?</li>
  <li>Related Work (brief; additional details can be moved to the appendix)</li>
  <li>A clear description of the method, with as many details as possible. Diagrams encouraged.</li>
  <li>Data used. If new data was collected, detailed description of the collection / preprocessing.</li>
  <li>Experimental settings, which model / tools were used, as well as hyperparameter settings.</li>
  <li>Quantitative results in a tabular format, as well as textual description. Qualitative results (for e.g., input / output pairs from your model) are encouraged. If too large, can add to appendix and point to it.</li>
  <li>Analysis / discussion of the key findings (was your hypothesis satisfied?) and future work.</li>
  <li>References (please follow the formatting closely).</li>
  <li>Appendix (unlimited length) with all additional details.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please use the appendix for any additional details which do not fit 8 pages, as well as point to the appendix from the main report. Please include a (Github) link to the code. All projects will be graded taking into consideration prior feedback given throughout the project.</p> -->
